# Heterogeneous Solvers for Linear Systems with SPD Matrices

This project was created as part of a master thesis.

It contains code for two heterogeneous solvers that can leverage the CPU and GPU simultaneously: a heterogeneous
implementation of the CG method and a heterogeneous Cholesky decomposition implementation.

The code is parallelized on the CPU and GPU using [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/).

## Features

- Parallel, heterogeneous SYCL implementation of the CG method
- Parallel, heterogeneous SYCL implementation of the Cholesky decomposition
- GPU support for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel through SYCL
- Sampling of hardware metrics with the [hws-library](https://github.com/SC-SGS/hardware_sampling)

## Installation

The project supports the SYCL implementation [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp) and requires a
Linux operating system.

The AdaptiveCpp compiler that has been used for the experiment environment can be installed using the script
`install_AdaptiveCpp.sh`.
The script installs AdaptiveCpp v25.02.0 and builds it against LLVM version 19.1.0 which is build from source.

Before running the script ensure that the CUDA/ROCm/oneAPI environment is loaded correctly. Usage:

```
./install_AdaptiveCpp.sh <GPU vendor: "NVIDIA", "AMD" or "INTEL"> <Base directory> <#Jobs for compilation (e.g. core count)> <AMD only: ROCm path>
```

After the installation of AdaptiveCpp, clone this repository and create a build directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/TimThuering/Heterogeneous-Solvers.git
cd Heterogeneous-Solvers
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Building the project with AdaptiveCpp

The following command builds the Projects with the AdaptiveCpp CUDA backend for NVIDIA GPUs and the OpenMP backend for
CPUs.

Ensure that the CUDA environment and the AdaptiveCpp compiler are correctly loaded.
The project has been tested with CUDA 12.2.2 and
AdaptiveCpp [v25.02.0](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp/tree/v25.02.0).

Replace `sm_XX` with the correct [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) of your GPU, for example
`sm_80`.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=acpp -DACPP_TARGETS="cuda:sm_XX;omp.accelerated" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" ..
make
```

Verify that the correct compilers are used by CMake. Alternatively specify the absolute path for `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`
and
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
If problems occur during compilation try setting `-DAdaptiveCpp_DIR=<acpp install path>/lib/cmake/AdaptiveCpp`.
For further information about AdaptiveCpp please refer to the
official [documentation](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp/blob/develop/doc/using-acpp.md).

To build the project for AMD GPUs set the cmake variable `-DGPU_VENDOR="AMD"` and replace `cuda:sm_XX` with
`hip:gfxXXX`.
Set `gfxXXX` correctly according to your AMD GPU, for example, `gfx90a`.
Make sure that ROCm is loaded correctly before the installation. The project has been tested with ROCm 6.4.0.

To build the project for Intel GPUs set the cmake variable `-DGPU_VENDOR="INTEL"` and replace `cuda:sm_XX` with
`generic`.
Make sure oneAPI is loaded correctly before the installation. The project has been tested with oneAPI 2025.1.

### Running the program

The example below generates a kernel matrix, parses a right-hand side and solves the system heterogeneously on the GPU
and CPU with the Cholesky decomposition.

```
./heterogeneous_solvers --gp_input="<path to training input data>" --gp_output="<path to training output data>" --algorithm=cholesky --size=32768 --init_gpu_perc=0.45 --matrix_bsz=128
```

The tables below show a list of the mandatory and optional arguments to customize the program execution.

The first option to define the matrix for the linear system: Generation of a kernel matrix based on input data.
An exemplary dataset to generate such kernel matrices can, for example, be found in the repository by [Helmann et al.](https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/DARUS-4743).

It is recommended to specify the environment variables `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `OMP_PROC_BIND` when using the CPU-only or
heterogeneous execution.
For the heterogeneous execution it is recommended to disable simultaneous multi threading.

Sampling of CPU metrics with the hws-library might require root privileges.
