# Heterogeneous Solvers for Linear Systems with SPD Matrices

--- 

This project was created as part of a master thesis.

It contains code for two heterogeneous solvers that can leverage the CPU and GPU simultaneously: a heterogeneous implementation of the CG method and a heterogeneous Cholesky decomposition implementation.

The code is parallelized on the CPU and GPU using [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/).

## Features
- Parallel, heterogeneous SYCL implementation of the CG method
- Parallel, heterogeneous SYCL implementation of the Cholesky decomposition
- GPU support for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel through SYCL

## Installation

The project supports the SYCL implementation [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp) and requires a Linux operating system.
